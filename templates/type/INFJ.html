      <h1>INFJ strengths and weaknesses</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h2>INFJs at their best</h2>
      <p>
        People with INFJ preferences often want to change the world for the
        better. They’re idealists; they want to make things better for those who
        really need it, and they enjoy helping others to grow and become better
        versions of themselves. They’re also independent and often know exactly
        what they want to do next without needing to ask for advice or guidance.
        INFJs tend to come across as quiet and reserved. They’re often saving
        their energy for the people who mean the most to them, which may make
        those who receive this energy feel special.
      </p>
      <h2>Potential development areas for INFJs</h2>
      <p>
        Because they’re so deep and sensitive, it’s easy for INFJs to get their
        feelings hurt. Their idealism also makes them critical of others who
        don’t seem to care as much as they do about humanitarian issues or
        fighting injustice. This critical approach could work against them if it
        discourages others from getting involved.
      </p>
      <h2>INFJs and stress</h2>
      <p>
        Because of their quiet, reserved nature, loud interruptions or
        conflicting personalities can create stress for people with INFJ
        preferences. They tend to dislike last-minute changes and repeated
        mistakes, which they see as thoughtless or uncaring. At work, INFJs may
        find it difficult to keep their personal feelings out of their
        interactions with others. They’ll likely become stressed if they feel
        unappreciated, dismissed, or ignored. If you have INFJ preferences, try
        these simple strategies to balance your feelings during times of stress:
         
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you feel hurt by something someone else has said or done, take a
          moment to consider if they actually meant to hurt you. The other
          person might be under stress or in a rush. They most likely didn’t
          mean to upset you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a schedule for yourself and share it with your team. This will
          let your colleagues know your preferred schedule and personal
          boundaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring headphones to work and listen to relaxing music. If you work in
          a loud environment, this can help you to avoid loud noises and other
          interruptions while still being physically present and available.
        </li>
      </ul>
